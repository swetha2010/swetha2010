'''Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.
For example, [[2, 4, 6, 2, 5]] should return
[13], since we pick 2, 6, and 5
[5, 1, 1, 5] should return | 10 |, since we
pick 5 and 5'''

a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

if len(a)==2:
    print(max(a))
else:
    for i in range(1,len(a)):
        b,c = max(c,b),b+a[i]
    print(max(b,c))
