'''Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i
For example, if our input was
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]]. If our input was
[3, 2, 1], the expected output would be
[[2, 3, 6]]'''
