 # In the image below you can see the first iteration is only asingle dot. On the second, thereare 6 dots. On the third, there are 
 #  16 dots, and on the fourth there are 31 dots. 
  
 # ? 1 => 1 
 # ? 2 => 6 
 # ? 3 => 16 
 # ? 4 => 31 
 # ? 8 => 141 
  
 # Return the number of dots that exist in the whole pentagon on the Nth iteration.
